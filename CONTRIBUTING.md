# Contributing to Count to 6

What Count to 6 needs most is *ideas*. In particular, concrete plans for how to teach a feature.

[The issues list](https://github.com/domenic/count-to-6/issues) has lots of desired features opened as issues. The main missing thing is coming up with exercises that test those features. How do we fit into the run + verify Nodeschool format?

So far we have two forms of verification: comparing standard out, and running a number of tests to verify that a single function behaves correctly. Neither of these *actually* tests ES6 usage; you could use pure ES5 syntax and pass them. So alternate verification forms might be very helpful. [Issue #9](https://github.com/domenic/count-to-6/issues/9) tracks brainstorming for those.

In general, if you can come up with a plan for an exercise, the coding part is not that hard, and I am happy to do it for you, or help along the way. But ideas! Ideas are key.
